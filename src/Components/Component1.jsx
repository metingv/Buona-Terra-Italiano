                <p>Buona Terra means ‘Good Earth’ in Italian. Buona Terra is an ode to the Italian love affair with food and dining … perhaps the only way to dine! With the whole of Italy as his inspiration and larder, Chef Denis Lucchi personally handpicks the finest produce of its soil. Then, brilliantly reinventing tradition, he transforms these luscious ingredients into contemporary works of art. Buona Terra is Italian food-craft at its most thoughtful and original and gastronomically refined. It is also a return to cherished basics: the conscious, unhurried enjoyment of flavours; the hospitality that makes you feel right at home; and the enduring memories that come from a truly great meal and a special experience.</p>
