                <p>Buona Terra serves contemporary Italian cuisine shaped by the personal vision of Chef Denis Lucchi. It starts with a ‘gourmet larder’ assembled from all the places in Italy where Chef Denis knows the best producers and their foodstuffs are located. These prized artisanal ingredients and the Italian recipes Chef Denis grew up with are the jump-off points for culinary artistry and adventure. Because of these, Chef Denis creates reinterpretations with more complex and intense flavours than the traditional dish, presenting them individually in contrast to the typically shared platters.
                    There is a sense of challenge and pushing the envelope; of new discovery. Yet in the soul, Buona Terra is nothing but Italian – proudly, quintessentially, sublimely.</p>
